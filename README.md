# Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis Web Application

## Overview

This web application is a tool designed to assist in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, by analyzing MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. It combines a user-friendly interface with a deep learning model to provide predictions based on image data.

## Features

* **MRI Image Analysis:**
    * Users can upload MRI images in common formats.
    * The application processes the images and uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the likelihood of the presence of a neurodegenerative disease.
    * The prediction result (e.g., "Alzheimer's Prediction" or "Cognitive Normal") is displayed to the user.
* **Data Display from CSV Files:**
    * Users can upload CSV files containing relevant data.
    * The application displays the data in a tabular format, allowing for easy viewing and analysis.
* **Alzheimer's Disease Insights:**
    * The application provides a section with information about Alzheimer's disease, including:
        * Types of Alzheimer's disease
        * Stages of the disease
        * Key risk factors
        * Common symptoms
        * Diagnosis methods
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * The application is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive and easy-to-use web interface.

## How It Works

1.  **MRI Image Upload:**
    * The user uploads an MRI image through the web interface.
2.  **Image Processing:**
    * The application processes the uploaded image to prepare it for analysis by the CNN. This may include resizing and normalization.
3.  **Disease Prediction:**
    * The processed image is fed into a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
    * The CNN analyzes the image and outputs a prediction, indicating the likelihood of the presence of a neurodegenerative disease.
4.  **Result Display:**
    * The application displays the prediction result to the user.
5.  **CSV Data Display:**
    * If the user uploads a CSV file, the application uses Pandas to display the data in a tabular format.
6.  **Information Display:**
     * The application displays information about Alzheimer's disease.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Streamlit
* TensorFlow/Keras
* Pandas
* Pydicom
* PIL (Pillow)

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.7 or higher
    * Pip
    * Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

2.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git)
    cd your_repository_name
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing the dependencies.)*
    *Example `requirements.txt`:*
        ```
        streamlit
        tensorflow
        pandas
        pydicom
        Pillow
        ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

##   Explanation of Key Components

* **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
    * A type of deep learning model used for image analysis.  The CNN is trained to recognize patterns in MRI images that are indicative of neurodegenerative diseases.
* **Streamlit:**
    * A Python framework used to build the web application interface.  Streamlit allows for the creation of interactive web apps with minimal code.

##   How to Use the Application

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Upload an MRI image for analysis.
3.  View the prediction result.
4.  Optionally, upload a CSV file to view its data.
5.  View the information about Alzheimer's disease.

##   Notes for Users
* The application is not a substitute for professional medical advice.  Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

##   Future Improvements
* Improve the accuracy of the CNN model.
* Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., clinical data, genomic data).
* Add more features to the web application.
